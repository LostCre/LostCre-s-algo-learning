# LostCre-s-algo-learning
勇士啊，恭喜你发现了华中科技大学著名**菜鸟**LostCre的代码仓库！

##该仓库出现的原因
本人打算整该仓库有以下几点原因
1. 众所周知，人的记忆力是有限的，某些记忆不常被调用就容易出现一些问题，如丢失、错乱等，因此该仓库可以存放一些个人对部分算法的理解以及一些题目的解题代码
2. 个人私心，想记录下自己算法学习的历程，以及自己做出难题的“优越感”

至于会不会做下去就得看个人坚持了(可能会懒得写之类的)/hanx

# En.ver:
Congratulations!Your find the code warehouse owing by LostCre who is a extremely stupid noob in Huazhong University of Science and Technology(HUST).

##Reasons for the birth of this warehouse
There are somg following reasongs for my creating this git
1. As we know, we are eazy to forget some "important" things when we have not "use" them for a long time, which may result in confusion, missing etc.. Therefore, this git could storage my note of some my limited understanding of algorithms and codes for some hard questions.
2. Out of selfishness, I want to record my experiences of algorithm learning and my happiness of solving complex problems.

(My English is bad, so if there is somg wrong in "En.ver", message me.Thanks a lot!)
